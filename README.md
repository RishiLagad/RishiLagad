- # 👋 Hi, I’m @Rushikesh_Lagad

👀 I’m interested in bioinformatics, computational biology, and the integration of multi-omics data to enhance our understanding of complex diseases like cancer.

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced techniques in spatial transcriptomics, focusing on its application in cancer research to map tumor microenvironments and understand cellular interactions.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve single-cell sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, or any innovative bioinformatics approaches that can lead to novel therapeutic insights.

😄 Pronouns: He/Him

⚡ Fun fact: Besides my passion for bioinformatics, I enjoy hiking and photography, Canoeing often exploring ways to capture the beauty of nature through the lens of science.
